I have repeated base information about web page structure and styling. I expanded my knowledge in HTML & CSS, and that will be helpful in my future studying of the web development.

I have learned about useful methodologies that helped to make a responsive and adaptive website. It's very important to understand the way you can make a great website for mobile devices. I'll use this in my future projects.

Thank's to that course I become more confident in  JavaScript, had repeat key concepts of this programming language. Also, I really like freecodecamp challenges, they expect that you will you JS methods to solve those problems.

## DOM

It was really interesting to understand how javascript works in the browser, and how to manipulate page content with this programming language. That's very important to know how to build sings using vanilla js, without additional libraries and frameworks.

It was really cool, to examine my DOM knowledge in real case. Only when you're coding you can become better as a developer. This practice task teached me how to manipulate DOM data, how to make web-app responsive and addaptive. Thank's to @zonzujiro
i've simplified my code solution and become more confident with array methods.
