It was really interesting to understand how javascript works in the browser, and how to manipulate page content with this programming language. That's very important to know how to build sings using vanilla js, without additional libraries and frameworks.

It was really cool, to examine my DOM knowledge in real case. Only when you're coding you can become better as a developer. This practice task teached me how to manipulate DOM data, how to make web-app responsive and addaptive. Thank's to @zonzujiro
i've simplified my code solution and become more confident with array methods.

Very useful info, about Objects, prototyping, inference. Javascript OOP a bit different than in other programming languages.  It's very comfortable to use OOP in real practical situations, so I'll use this knowledge in my future projects.

Awesome challenge, after all, theoretical and practical OOP challenges, you back and fix your code with new OOP knowledge.
Thank's to  @AMashoshyna I defined a new method in the parent class and overloaded it in child classes, so they have some individual properties, so I become to understand inherence better.
