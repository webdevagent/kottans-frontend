This learning resources helped me to understand why I need to use version control. The materials are well structured and are good for newbie. Also i like, that they use "learn by doing" methodology.

Great learning material, that gives me opportunity, to feel more comfortable with command line tools.
I'll use this experience in my future projects, i think it will be helpful.
